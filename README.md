# Hi There, I am Leonardo Moreno ðŸ‘‹

My primary focus is on frontend development, where I specialize in building interactive and user-friendly web applications. I have extensive knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Typescript, and I'm proficient in popular frameworks and libraries such as React and Anime.js.

I love working on the frontend because it allows me to combine my creativity with problem-solving skills to deliver exceptional user experiences.

I'm currently very focused on delving into AI
